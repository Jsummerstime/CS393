The SQL file builds a information system for a flash card study service similiar to Quizlet.

Full description:

The study sets contain flashcards that can be read. Each study set may or may not be associated with a particular academic course. 
It is also associated with a school and user account. Study sets are labeled by the user that created the study set. 
Metadata about each study set includes what user created the set, and how many flashcards are in a study set. 
The system assigns a unique identifier to each study set.
Each study set has its own unique name. However, more than one study set can have the same name if each study set is associated with 
a different academic class or school. Each academic class and school have a name and a unique identifier generated by the system. 
Academic classes are connected to at least one school and must contain at least one study set. Each study set must have a name and a user who created it.
Members have a unique username and password and can use the study service for free. Members enter their desired username, email, and school. 
Members can search schools and their associated classes; members can also search study sets by name or by academic class. 
Members can also search other members by name to view the study sets that member has created. 
Members can study/read the flash cards of any given study set. They can also create, update, or delete study sets and academic classes. 
The relationship between study sets and academic classes is like a file to a folder. 
The study sets are files that can be stored in academic class folders. Members can also enter what school each academic class is associated with. 
Study sets may contain an unlimited amount of flash cards; however, a user can only maintain 7 academic class folders at one time. 
Additionally, each academic class folder can only be associated with one school. Each study set can be studied in order or randomly shuffled. 
Study guide administrators can remove study sets and academic classes from the system. 
They can also create and update academic class folders and their associated study sets. 
Administrators can also update metadata associated with members, schools, academic classes, and study sets. 

The database has seven tables:

The school table has two attributes: schoolName and institution type.
The user table has five attributes: userID, username, email, password, isAdmin.
The member table is subtable of the user table. Two additional attributes it has are school, and startDate.
The administrator table is a subtable of the user table. Two additional attributes it has are permissoinLvl, and position.
The academicClassFolder table has two attibutes: className, userID.
The studySet table has four attributes: setID, studySetName, className, numberOfCards.
The card table has three attributes: cardTerm, Note, setID.

There are nine procedures implemented within the MySQL script:

viewStudySet('enter name of study set') -- view cards within a specified study set.
enterPersonalInfo('username', 'email', 'password') -- Enter the desired username for an account. Enter the email to be associated with account. 
                                                   -- Enter a desired password for an account.
searchForStudySet('search by', 'item') -- Query the system for a specific study set by name, username, class name, or school. Display available options based off the search.
createClassFolder('username', 'class name') -- add a new class folder to a specific user account.
createStudySet('title', 'class') -- add a new study set to a specific class folder.
deleteStudySet('nameGiven', 'classGiven' -- delete the study set and its cards. enter desired set name and its class to delete.
updateStudySet('nameGiven', 'cardGiven', 'termGiven', 'noteGiven') -- enter desired set to update, enter desired card to update, enter new term for card
                                                                   -- enter new defintion for card.
updateUserMetadata('userIDGiven', 'newUserName', 'newSchool', 'newEmail', 'newPassword') -- only admin members can update the information of regular users.
updateSchoolMetadata('schoolNameGiven', 'newSchoolName') -- only admin members can update the name of a school
